# Online-Grocery-Store
The web based “Online Grocery Store System” project is an attempt to stimulate the basic concepts of Grocery Store. The system enables the customer to do the things such as search for Products category wise, choose products based on description and add that product into cart. The system provides you details about product. If user want to buy product, he must have registered account. The system shows the product that are available or that are in stock, the system displays price, quantity, availability of product to user as well as employees of store Here we provided products by category wise that allows customer to choose a particular product easily. The product which are not in stock, user cannot add that products into cart. If the products are available then the system allows the user to add product into cart. To place ordersystem, ask user to select the address and payment mode. If address is not provided the user can’t place order, Userhave to specify the address before placing order. After selecting address and payment mode user can place order and the same updates will be done in database.
